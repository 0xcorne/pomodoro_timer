# pomodoro_timer
// Pomodoro is a popular method for timemanagement, which I frequently use while coding. Instead of searching a YT video which has the exact Pomodoro timings I like, I thought why not create a web-tool myself. So I did! I can highly recommend working with the Pomodoro method if you never did, my productivity literally doubled when I started using it.
